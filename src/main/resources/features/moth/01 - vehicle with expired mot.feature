  Scenario: A MOTH user searches for a vehicle with an expired MOT
    Given I browse to /

    And I enter {registration} in the registration field
    When I press the "Continue" button

    Then The page contains "{registration}"
    And The page contains "{model}"
    And The page title contains "Check MOT history"
