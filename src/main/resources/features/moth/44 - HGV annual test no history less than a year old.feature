    Given I browse to /
    And I enter "NOHIST1" in the registration field
    When I press the "Continue" button

    Then The page contains "NOHIST1"
    And The page contains "CONVERSION"
    And The page does not contain "This vehicle's first annual test is due soon"
    And The page contains "First annual test due"
    And I click the accordion section with the id "mot-history-description"

    And The page contains "This vehicle hasn't had its first annual test."
    And The page contains "The annual test changed on 20 May 2018"
    And The page does not contain "Defects are now categorised according to their severity â€“ dangerous, major, and minor."
    And The page contains "Find out more"

    And I click the last "Find out more" link
