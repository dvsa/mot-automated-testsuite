Feature: 01 - Check vehicle with expired MOT

  Scenario: A MOTH user searches for a vehicle with an expired MOT
    Given I browse to /
    And I load "VEHICLE_REG_MOT_EXPIRED" as {registration}, {model}, {date}, {mot_expiry}
    And I enter {registration} in the registration field
    When I press the "Continue" button

    Then The page contains "{registration}"
    And The page contains "{model}"
    And The page title contains "{model} - Check MOT history"
    And The page contains "This vehicle's MOT has expired"
    And The page contains "You can be fined up to Â£1000 for driving without a valid MOT"
    And The page contains "Colour"
    And The page contains "Fuel type"
    And The page contains "Petrol"
    And The page contains "Date registered"
    And The page contains "{date}"
    And The page contains "MOT expired on"
    And The page contains "{mot_expiry}"
    And The page contains "MOT History"
    And The page contains "Mileage recorded at test, parts failed or had minor problems"
