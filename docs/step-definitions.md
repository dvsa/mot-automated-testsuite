# Step Definitions

A manually maintained summary of the steps defined in the fixture Java classes is given below.

In general the following syntax is used:

* Hard-coded test data is surrounded with ```".."```
* Test data loaded from the database is surrounded with ```{..}```

## Generic

These steps are completely generic to any web application.

### WebStepDefinitions

Note, in the steps below:
* ```"..text with {key}s.."``` can contain:
  * Hard-coded text, possibly with data keys (```{key}```), which will be replaced by the data value
  * Single-quotes (```'```), but **not** double-quotes (```"```)
  
High level:

* I browse to ```URL```
* I press the ```"..button text.."``` button
* I click the button which contains text ```"..button text.."```
   * Note: this finds the text element then clicks the button that is its ancestor. For use with nested tags in buttons.
* I click the button with class name ```"..class name.."```
   * Note: this should only be used when this is the only way to identify the button
* I click the ```..text with {key}s..``` link
* I click the ```{key}``` link
* I click the first ```"..text with {key}s.."``` link
* I click the first ```{key}``` link
* I click the last ```"..text with {key}s.."``` link
* I click the last ```{key}``` link
* I click the ```..text..``` link for the ```..heading text..``` field row
   * Note: expects a link in a ```td``` element in the same row as a ```th``` element with the heading text
* I click the ```..name..``` icon
   * Note: expects an ```i``` element with a Font Awesome class of the form ```fa-{..name..}```
* I accept the alert popup
* I dismiss the alert popup 
* I click the ```..label..``` radio button
* I click the ```{key}``` radio button
* I click the ```..label..``` radio button in fieldset ```..legend..```
* I click the ```{key}``` radio button in fieldset ```..legend..```
* I click the ```..label..``` radio button in fieldset ```..nested legend..``` in fieldset ```..legend..```
* I click the ```{key}``` radio button in fieldset ```..nested legend..``` in fieldset ```..legend..```
   * Note: all radio button steps handle labels with ```for``` and radio inputs nested inside the label 
* I click the ```..label..``` checkbox   
   * Note: ensures field is set - clicks the checkbox if not already selected, otherwise does nothing
* I clear the ```..label..``` checkbox   
   * Note: all checkbox steps handle labels with ```for``` and checkbox inputs nested inside the label 
   * Note: ensures field is not set - clicks the checkbox if already selected, otherwise does nothing   
* I enter ```"..text.."``` in the ```"..label.."``` field
* I enter ```"..text.."``` in the ```{..label key..}``` field
* I enter ```{key}``` in the ```"..label.."``` field
* I enter ```{key}``` in the ```{..label key..}``` field
* I enter ```"..text.."``` in the ```"..field label.."``` field in fieldset ```..fieldset label..```
* I enter ```{key}``` in the ```"..field label.."``` field in fieldset ```..fieldset label..```
* I select ```"..item.."``` in the ```"..label.."``` field
* The page contains ```"..text with {key}s.."```
* The page contains ```"..text with {key}s.."``` or ```"..text with {key}s.."```
* The page does not contain ```"..text with {key}s.."```
* The page title contains ```"..text.."```
* I check there is a ```"..text with {key}s.."``` link
* I check there is no ```"..text with {key}s.."``` link
* I check the ```"..button text.."``` button is disabled
* I check the ```"..button text.."``` button is enabled
* I check there is no ```"..button text.."``` button
* I check the table with heading ```"..text.."``` has at least ```..num..``` rows
   * Note: counts the number of table rows, excluding the heading row
* I check the ```"..heading text.."``` field row has value ```"..value.."```
* I check the ```"..heading text.."``` field row has value ```{key}```
   * Note: these steps check the contents of a ```td``` element in the same row as a ```th``` element with the heading text 
* I check the ```"..heading text.."``` field column has value ```"..value.."```
* I check the ```"..heading text.."``` field column has value ```{key}```
   * Note: these steps check the contents of the ```td``` element in the first row and same column as a ```th``` element with the heading text    
* I check the alert popup contains ```"..text.."```
* I check the ```"..name.."``` cookie is set
* I delete the ```"..name.."``` cookie
   * Note: allows partial match of the cookie name
* I wait for ```"..number.."``` seconds
* I set the starting url key as ```"..starting url key.."```

Lower level, only use if higher level steps can't be used:

* I enter ```"..text.."``` in the field with id ```"..id.."```
* I enter ```{key}``` in the field with id ```"..id.."```
* I select ```"..text.."``` in the field with id ```"..id.."```


### DataStepDefinitions

* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```
* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```
* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```
* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```
* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```
* I load ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```, ```{key6}```
    * Note: these steps will load the next entry from the cached dataset. Each dataset is read at the start of the testsuite execution
    * Note: if data filtering (parallel execution) is on, each entry will be unique across all tests
    * Note: this is the recommended way to load data
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```
* I load immediately ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```, ```{key6}```
    * Note: these steps will load the first entry in the dataset immediately without any caching
    * Note: this should only be used for data that changes during the test itself
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```
* I load uniquely ```"..dataset name.."``` as ```{key1}```, ```{key2}```, ```{key3}```, ```{key4}```, ```{key5}```, ```{key6}```
    * Note: if the testsuite is in parallel mode, these steps operate like ```I load ...``` (using caching and data filtering)
    * Note: if not in parallel mode, these steps operate like ```I load immediately ...``` (loading immediately) 
    * Note: use this as a temporary work-around for data that can be affected/invalidated by other tests
    * Note: once sufficient data exists to use parallel/data filtering in all environment, replace with ```I load ...```    
* I set today as ```{..day key..}```, ```{..month key..}```, ```{..year key..}```  
    * Note: this sets the current date (day/month/year as integers)
* I set today formatted using ```"..date time format string.."``` as ```{key}```
    * Note: supports ```java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter``` format strings 
    (see [DateTimeFormatter JavaDoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html))
