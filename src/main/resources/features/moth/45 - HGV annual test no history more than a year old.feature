Feature: 45 - Check HGV that has no Annual Test history and the vehicle is more than a year old

  Scenario: A MOTH user searches for a HGV that has no Annual Test history and the vehicle is more than a year old
    Given I browse to /
    And I enter "NOHOLD2" in the registration field
    When I press the "Continue" button

    Then The page contains "NOHOLD2"
    And The page contains "CONVERSION"
    And The page contains "This vehicle's annual test has expired"
    And The page contains "You can be fined up to Â£1,000 for driving without a valid annual test"
    And The page contains "Annual test expired on"
    And I click the accordion section with the id "mot-history-description"

    And The page contains "No annual test results found."
