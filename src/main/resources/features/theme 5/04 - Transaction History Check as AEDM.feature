  Scenario: AEDM can view transaction history
    # We are purposefully picking AE with the most transactions available so we definately have results and pagination
    Given I login with 2FA using "AEDM_USER_WITH_TRANSACTIONS" as {AEDM}, {ORGANISATION}, {COUNT}, {AEREF}
    And I click the first {ORGANISATION} link
    And I click the "Transaction history" link

    When I click the "Today" link
    Then The summary line contains "today"

    Then The summary line contains "last 7 days"

    # All transactions is the only link we are guaranteed to have CSV link and pagination
    When I click the "All Transactions" link
